/*

I would prefer to use @container in "phase-4-ninja-desktop.css" for handling
desktop layout, but while implemented by all recent browser versions, it has
not yet made it into the standards, and is rejected by validators.

    .ninja-app
    {
        container-type: inline-size;
    }

    @container (width > 15em)
    {
        Current content of "phase-4-ninja-desktop.css"
    }

Getting the correct appearance using @media depends on knowing how other
CSS rules affect the size of the aside, which makes the solution rather
fragile.
