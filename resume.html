            Before attending UWA, I spent time at Beehive Montessori, Nedlands Primary,
            and Hollywood High schools.  I took the standard subjects for someone intending
            to study a science-based subject at UWA: physics, chemistry, the two TEE math units,
            and English Literature.  Social sciences, photography, and cooking rounded things
            out, from what I remember.

            My time there was split between Linguistics, Mathematics, and Computer Science.
            While completing enough units for a major in pure mathematics, my official majors
            were in Linguistics and Computing, and honours was split between the two.

            group focused on shallow techniques for NLP – particularly in the area of text generation.

            At the end of my time in Sydney, I was depressed and in fairly poor health.
            Nothing was ever resolved as to what was wrong with me, but I ended up abandoning
            work on my thesis and came back to Perth.  This lasted for almost a decade,
            with me doing small projects and maintenance work on the software that I wrote
            for ATTA, before COVID arrived and I started to regain my interest in life.
            Since then, I have worked to regain some skills that might be useful in finding work,
            probably in the IT industry.

            Towards the end of the COVID epidemic, it seemed like if I were to get any jobs
            where I needed to attend in person then it would be useful to know something about
            infection control.  There were free online courses on offer through TAFE, and I took one
            as both a means to prepare for work in a world where COVID was still a major issue,
            and to get myself back into shape to study and work.
